1.Please describe the current development stage of the project. *
  We are making a DEX that provides the BEST PRICE SWAP on Binance Smart Chain that supports a split-routing swap, which will divide source tokens into multiple routes and swap them on different pools across all aggregated DEXs simultaneously. 
  This strategy not only reduces price impact but also maximizes desired tokens. We've done 75% of development work and expected to launch DEX in July month as mentioned in our Roadmap.

2.What is the long-term vision of the Project and how do you expect to get there? *
  We are completely focused on developing tech and also on marketing in the next 2 quarters. Have prepared complete Roadmap of ParaDex project up to December month with a timeline, one by one our expert team achieving that milestones in specified given time. We have a team of Top Blockchain experts with innovative blockchain 
  solutions and ideas, having experience of more than 4 years in Ethereum, Hyperledger, and other blockchains.

3.How much would your project like to raise (USD value)? *
  we are looking to raise 20,00,000 USD ( 20 millions $PRAD = 0.1 BUSD for IFO).

4.What is the expected valuation of your project? *
  We are expecting at least 100 million valuations in the year-end with our complete DEX.

5.What will you use the raised funds for? *
  The ParaDex project is 100% transparent and community-governed, 90% of raised funds would be locked in Pancakeswap forever. Pancakeswap would be a Major trading DEX for $PRAD token.
  The remaining 10% would be used for Centralized Exchange listing, further development purposes, marketing, and partnerships, etc.

  We are looking for IFO on 28/06/2021.
